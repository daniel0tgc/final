## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Start the platform:
```bash
cd /workspace
./start-platform.sh
```

2. Ensure all services are running:
- Frontend (port 3000)
- Backend (port 4000)

2. Test Tool Approval
   - Open agent chat
   - Send message: "Send an email to test@example.com saying hello"
   - Verify approval request appears in chat
   - Test both approve and reject workflows
   - Check logs page for tool execution records

### Test 2: A2A Communication

1. Create Multiple Agents
   - Create 2+ agents with different capabilities
   - Start all agents

2. Test Agent Communication
   - Navigate to /collaboration
   - Send messages between agents
   - Create collaborative tasks
   - Monitor A2A logs in real-time

### Test 3: Logging and Monitoring

1. Access Logs Page
